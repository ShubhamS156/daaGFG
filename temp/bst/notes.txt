(if marked yellow means important)
Self Balancing Trees;
    AVL==> strict in terms of height means more rotations and restructuring
    Red Black==> looser in terms of height less restructuring and hence used more . Also used in c++, java libs
In c++ set(implementation of red black bst) has a function lower_bound which finds the ceiling of a number in the tree.

If there is a question to check if the structure of two binary tree is same then one possible solution is that maintain leftCount and rightCount of nodes and if they are
equal for every node then they are identical in structure;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tricks
    1-> compare the root and go left/right accordingly
    2-> use markings in floor,ceil like questions
    3-> pass range in which the elements should be like in nodeDetails questions
    4-> mark each vertical level starting from root as zero +1 for right and
        -1 for left subtree
