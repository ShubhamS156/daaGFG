 
to check if a number is repeated in a consecutive sorted array: 
n=size of array 
    x=n-(arr[n-1]-arr[0]);
    x is number of times a number  is getting repeated  

rolling hash: if hash can be computed from previous hash

in arr of length n there can be n-m+1 windows of length m

weighted sum hash function for rolling hash:
t[i+1]= d*(t[i]-txt[i]^m-1) + txt[i+m];
